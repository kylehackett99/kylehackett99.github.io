    <h1>Password Generator</h1>
    <p>The Password Generateor was developed in May 2020 right after the Spring Semester concluded. 
      It was made to help generate safe passwords for users as well as to learn 
      Python. The password generator recives a phrase and a password length from the user. 
      It then manipulates that phrase to be a stronger, safer password, and then adds or removes 
      characters so it is the desired length. It then runs the password through a hashing algorithm 
      to see if the password has already been cracked, and if it is a new password it is displayed 
      for the user to copy to their clipboard.

    <h1>This Website</h1>
    <p>This website was first constructed in May and June 2020 as a way to self-teach HTML, CSS, 
      and Javascript. It's designed to allow potiential employers and peers to view projects that I
      participated and just as form of personal expression.

    <h1>High School Projects</h1>
    <p>While the following activities/projects are from years ago, they made massive impacts on
      my charactacter and led me to the career I am working towards today.

    <h3>TJ^2 Robotics</h3>
    <p>I was a member of TJ^2, which was Bridgewater-Raynham Regional High School's FIRST robotics team.
      I joined sophomore year, where I primatily worked on assembly. But from there I joined the strategy
      group and developed my interpersonal skills and data analytics, by senior year I was a member of
      the programming team. I was taking my first programming course at the time, but I got my feet wet 
      working on the robot's intake mechanism, as well as coding some of it's sensors. That first experience
      planted the seed that later pushed me to changing my major to computer science.

    <h3 >Eagle Project</h3>
    <p>This project was conducted throughout 2017 and 2018 as a requirement to attain the rank of
      Eagle in the Boy Scouts of America. I worked with the community to fundraise, and build a kiosk
      for a local trail in Bridgwater Massachusetts which had been abandoned. In addition to the kiosk
    the trail was cleaned up, altared, and cartographed. Unfortunately it was vandlaized in 2019.
